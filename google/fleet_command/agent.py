# Fleet Command on ADK: the same four-agent crew, expressed in Google's own
# grammar. SequentialAgent replaces the hand-threaded `prior` strings from the
# Cloudflare runner: each agent writes an output_key into session state and the
# next agent's instruction reads it back as a {placeholder}. The intel lenses
# ride as tools on the agents that own them (SCOUT searches, SHIP checks the
# registrar), and the deploy gate is a require_confirmation tool, so the pause
# for a human is enforced by the framework instead of promised by a prompt.
