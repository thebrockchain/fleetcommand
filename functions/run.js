// POST /run : execute one agent step of a mission.
//
// Two honest modes, the fleet on-switch pattern:
//   LIVE   - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set as a Pages secret: the step is a real
//            Claude call and the response says mode "live".
//   REPLAY - no key: the step answers from a recorded run of the same mission
//            and the response says mode "replay". The UI labels it. Nothing
//            pretends to be live when it is not.
//
// The mission works a SYNTHETIC target (a fictional small-business site).
// No real site is scanned, no fleet data is read, nothing risky executes:
// the "ship" step never deploys anything anywhere, it stages a diff and
// waits at the approval gate. The gate is the product.
//
// Two agents carry a switch of their own, each honest about it on screen:
//   SCOUT  SERPAPI_KEY               -> real Google results for the market lens
//   SHIP   NAMECOM_USER + _TOKEN     -> a real registrar check on the deploy target
// Both read public records about the open market, not the target's systems, so
// they stay inside the same promise: nothing scans a real site.

Three observations for the crew. First, the order form posts to a route that answers 404, so the site is silently losing every order placed, in a market where ordering is the whole battleground. Second, the home hero ships a 4.2 MB image and paints in about six seconds on 4G, which is losing visitors before the menu loads. Third, the hours page and the footer disagree about Sundays, which erodes trust for a walk-in business.',
